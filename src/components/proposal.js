PCPSLF aims to make that decision easier, so that the vast majority of our nation's medical talent isn't funneled solely into specialty positions in wealthy urban centers. In addition, it improves and amends an existing program (PSLF) that is already funded by Congress, so you don't have to pay a single cent more in taxes.</p>

                            PSLF was created under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA). It encourages professionals with federal student loan debt to work full-time in public service. Only 96 people have had their loans forgiven through PSLF so far.

(See <a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/how-much-can-you-get-forgiven-via-pslf/" target="_blank">White Coat Investor</a>: "Since the amount you pay back is primarily determined by your salary and not the amount of loans you take out, thereâ€™s no disincentive to borrowing as much as you possibly can.")

                        <p>
                            PCPSLF was drafted by the Virginia Community Healthcare Association. Its intent is to fill the primary care physician shortage by removing financial barriers to entering the profession - primary, exorbitant student loans.

                                Close loophole for high earning professionals. For 501(c)3 organizations, applicants for PSLF at the end of the 10-year period must have a yearly income that is at least 2x their current remaining debt burden. This means that physicians who start making high incomes after fellowship (approx. 8 years after medical school) cannot "cheat" PSLF.

                                Primary care physicians, especially those who work at FQHCs, will save the healthcare system money in the long term by reducing downstream costs.
